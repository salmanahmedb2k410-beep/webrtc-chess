🌐 LAN Multiplayer Technical Overview

How It Works

webrtc-chess uses WebRTC to create a direct peer-to-peer connection:

```
┌─────────┐    Share compact codes    ┌─────────┐
│ Player 1 │  ←────────────────────→  │ Player 2 │
│  (Host)  │    (WhatsApp/SMS/AirDrop)  │  (Join)  │
└────┬────┘                            └────┬────┘
     │                                       │
     │─── Direct WebRTC DataChannel ────────→│
     │←───    (encrypted, P2P)         ─────│
     ↓                                       ↓
  Game Sync                               Game Sync
```

Compact SDP Encoding

Raw WebRTC SDP is ~1500 characters – too long to share manually. webrtc-chess compresses it to ~200 characters:

```javascript
// Raw SDP (excerpt - 1500+ chars)
v=0\r\no=- 4611744152874083702 2 IN IP4 127.0.0.1\r\ns=-\r\nt=0 0\r\n...

// Compact format
["o","kv5qj3n7","p4m2x8r9","A1B2C3D4E5F6...",["192.168.1.5:50789"]]
```

🧠 Chess Engine

webrtc-chess implements a full-featured chess engine with:

✅ Implemented Rules

· Standard piece movement (all pieces)
· Castling (kingside & queenside)
· En passant captures
· Pawn promotion (Q, R, B, N)
· Check and checkmate detection
· Stalemate detection
· 50-move rule
· Threefold repetition
· Insufficient material detection
· Algebraic notation generation

🔄 Move Validation

· Legal move generation for all pieces
· Pin detection (cannot move if exposes king)
· Check validation (must get out of check)
· Castling through check prevention

📊 Position Evaluation

· Material counting
· Balance visualization
· Captured pieces tracking

🛠️ Technology Stack

Technology Usage
HTML5 Structure, semantic markup
CSS3 Styling, Grid, Flexbox, animations, variables
Vanilla JavaScript Core logic, DOM manipulation, event handling
WebRTC Peer-to-peer data channels for LAN multiplayer
Web Audio API Sound effects without external files
localStorage Persistent settings storage

Zero Dependencies: No frameworks, no libraries, no build steps. Just pure, vanilla web technologies.

❓ FAQ

General

Q: Is webrtc-chess free?
A: Yes! Completely free and open-source under MIT license.

Q: Do I need to install anything?
A: No installation needed – just open the HTML file in any modern browser.

Q: Does it work offline?
A: Yes! Once loaded, it works completely offline. Even LAN multiplayer works without internet after connection.

Gameplay

Q: How do I castle?
A: Move the king two squares toward the rook. The move must be legal (no pieces between, not in/through check).

Q: What is en passant?
A: A special pawn capture when opponent moves two squares past your pawn. You must capture immediately on the next move.

Q: Can I have multiple queens?
A: Yes! Promote pawns to any piece, including additional queens.

LAN Multiplayer

Q: Why use codes instead of automatic discovery?
A: Automatic LAN discovery is unreliable across platforms. Codes are 100% reliable.

Q: The code has my IP address – is that safe?
A: Yes – it's your local IP (192.168.x.x), only visible to your friend on the same network.

Q: Can I play on mobile data?
A: Both devices must be on the same network. Using the same mobile hotspot works!

Q: Connection failed – what now?
A: Check troubleshooting guide in LAN Play Guide.

Technical

Q: How is this different from other chess apps?
A: webrtc-chess is unique because:

· Zero dependencies (pure vanilla JS)
· LAN multiplayer with compact codes
· Beautiful thematic design
· Complete rules implementation
